# Active Listening and Reflective Listening

## Steps/Strategies to Do Active Listening:
1. **Avoid Distractions**: Avoid getting distracted by your own thoughts. Focus on the speaker and topic instead.
2. **Don't Interrupt**: Try not to interrupt the other person. Let them finish and then respond.
3. **Use Door Openers**: Use phrases that show you are interested and keep the other person talking.
4. **Show Engagement**: Show that you are listening with body language.
5. **Take Notes**: If appropriate, take notes during important conversations.
6. **Paraphrase**: Paraphrase what others have said to make sure you are on the same page.

## Reflective Listening Based on Fisher's Model
Reflective listening focuses on understanding and clarifying what the other person is saying. Here are the key points:

1. **Active Engagement**: Listen closely to what the person is saying, showing that you are fully involved in the conversation.
2. **Reflect and Paraphrase**: Repeat back what you’ve heard in your own words. This helps confirm that you understand and allows the speaker to correct any misunderstandings.
3. **Acknowledge Feelings**: Show empathy by recognizing and validating the speaker’s emotions and feelings.
4. **Ask Clarifying Questions**: If something isn’t clear, ask questions to get more details and ensure you understand their message.
5. **Avoid Judgment**: Listen without making judgments or jumping to conclusions. Focus on understanding their perspective.

Reflective listening helps build better communication by ensuring both parties are on the same page and that emotions and thoughts are properly acknowledged.

# How to Make Your Communication Assertive

Becoming more assertive involves expressing your thoughts, feelings, and needs clearly and directly while respecting others. Here are some strategies to help develop assertive communication:

1. **Use “I” Statements**: Frame your messages in terms of your own feelings and experiences. For example, say, “I feel frustrated when meetings start late,” instead of “You always start meetings late.”

2. **Be Clear and Specific**: Clearly state what you need or want. Avoid vague language and be direct about your expectations.

3. **Maintain Positive Body Language**: Use eye contact, stand or sit up straight, and use a calm and steady voice. This helps convey confidence and openness.

4. **Practice Active Listening**: Show that you are listening by nodding, summarizing what the other person has said, and responding appropriately.

5. **Manage Your Emotions**: Stay calm and composed, even if the conversation becomes difficult. This helps you communicate more effectively and reduces the chance of becoming defensive or aggressive.

6. **Set Boundaries**: Clearly define your limits and stick to them. For example, if you are uncomfortable with a topic of conversation, politely state that you would prefer to discuss something else.

7. **Use Assertive Body Language**: Position yourself in a way that is open and confident. Avoid crossing your arms or appearing closed off.

8. **Practice Saying No**: Learn to say no when necessary without feeling guilty. You can do this respectfully by providing a clear reason if appropriate.

9. **Ask for Feedback**: Request feedback from others on how your communication is perceived and use it to improve.
